Technology has greatly improved aviation safety by helping pilots navigate, communicate, and avoid dangers. Systems like ADS-B and TCAS track aircraft to prevent collisions, while modern flight computers assist pilots in making safer decisions. Weather radar warns of storms, and AI analyzes flight data to detect risks early. These tools help pilots stay aware and reduce mistakes, making flights safer.
Technology also improves aircraft maintenance and training. Sensors and data analysis can predict mechanical problems before they happen, preventing failures. Virtual reality helps train pilots and crew for emergencies in a safe way. Cybersecurity protects planes from digital threats, keeping flight systems secure. With these advancements, aviation continues to become safer and more reliable.
