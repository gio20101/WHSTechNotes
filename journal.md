One event that interest me is the NBA or NFL games.These games use alot of technology and data analysis for example they use data analysis by recording every players stats like each point or assist they get.This shows how data analysis is used in the NBA and NFL.
The advancements in computer science and technology play a role in addressing NBA and NFL issuses in the future by helping the players stats not get confused or wrong.

One thing that excites me in a VR headset is the fact that its almost like living in a whole other world since you can move and interact with alot of things. It can innovate my field of interest by allowing me to play games.One ethical consideration that might need to be addressed as VR evolves is people using it more than real life.

Technology has greatly improved aviation safety by helping pilots navigate, communicate, and avoid dangers. Systems like ADS-B and TCAS track aircraft to prevent collisions, while modern flight computers assist pilots in making safer decisions. Weather radar warns of storms, and AI analyzes flight data to detect risks early. These tools help pilots stay aware and reduce mistakes, making flights safer.
Technology also improves aircraft maintenance and training. Sensors and data analysis can predict mechanical problems before they happen, preventing failures. Virtual reality helps train pilots and crew for emergencies in a safe way. Cybersecurity protects planes from digital threats, keeping flight systems secure. With these advancements, aviation continues to become safer and more reliable.

As a software developer for an NFL team, I would create an app that helps coaches make better in-game decisions using real-time data. The app would track player movements, analyze fatigue, predict plays, and study opponent strategies. It would use sensors and GPS to collect data, helping coaches adjust strategies on the spot.
To store and process the data, I would use databases for past stats and fast data structures for live updates. AI and machine learning would analyze patterns, suggest plays, and highlight player performance. The app would also feature easy-to-read dashboards with heat maps, charts, and real-time stats, giving coaches a clear view of what’s happening on the field. This would help the team make smarter, faster decisions during the game.

Technology can help educators and professionals keep up with youth slang using AI tools, slang dictionaries, and language apps. AI chatbots and translation tools can help bridge communication gaps, while social media tracking can show how slang evolves.
However, slang changes quickly and has different meanings in different cultures, which can cause misunderstandings. While teaching slang in schools could help, it’s important to stay professional. Using technology wisely can help adults connect with youth while avoiding confusion or miscommunication.

Technology has really changed how people watch and enjoy March Madness. Things like artificial intelligence can now help predict which teams might win and help fans make better brackets. This can be fun because it gives fans more ways to think about the games. But at the same time, part of what makes March Madness exciting is how unpredictable it is. I think AI can make it more interesting, but it shouldn’t take away the fun of surprise wins or unexpected moments.
Social media and streaming have also changed how fans stay connected to the tournament. Now, people don’t have to be in front of a TV—they can watch games, check scores, or see highlights right on their phones. It’s also easier to talk with friends and other fans online about what’s happening. These changes make watching March Madness feel more exciting and personal, even if you’re not at the game. It helps bring more people into the experience.

I am feeling good and the most stressful part of school lately has been getting my grades up.
# April 7, 2025
AI can help me study for tests like the STAAR by giving me quick answers and explaining things I don’t understand. I can ask it questions anytime, and it helps me learn faster. It can also give me practice questions so I know what kinds of things will be on the test.
The best part of an AI tutor for me would be helping me stay organized. Sometimes I don’t know what to study or I forget. AI could remind me and keep me on track. I would use it because it’s easy and helps me do better in school.

I think banning cell phones and social media in schools could be good because it helps students focus better in class. Without phones, there are fewer distractions, and students might pay more attention to their teachers and schoolwork. It could also cut down on cyberbullying since students wouldn’t be able to use social media during the day. However, some people worry about not being able to text their parents in an emergency or check important updates. Schools should find a way to limit distractions but still let students use phones when it’s really necessary.  

If my school banned phones, I’d probably be annoyed at first, but I’d try to follow the rules. Maybe the school could allow phone use during lunch or free periods so we don’t feel completely cut off. I also think teachers should explain why these rules exist—like how less screen time can help us learn better and get along with each other in person. Over time, I think students would get used to it and might even see the benefits, like better grades and fewer drama-filled group chats during school hours.

I dont think that 100 men could beat 1 glorilla since glorillas are just so strong.I also dont think that it is responsible to make this trend go viral because some people might actually try and fight a glorilla and get ingured or worse.I think that this shows that the internet could spread dumb ideas just for entertainment.
